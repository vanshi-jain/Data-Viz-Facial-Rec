# See It to Believe It: The Role of Data Visualization Tools in AI
## Facial Recognition and the Power of Data Visualization

Facial recognition technology has become crucial for unlocking both physical and digital doors by verifying identity through unique facial features. However, challenges such as lookalike faces and biased datasets can complicate the process, leading to potential risks in places like security checkpoints.

## Challenges in Facial Recognition

High-quality data is the backbone of reliable facial recognition. Yet, issues like:
- **Class imbalance**: Uneven distribution of data classes
- **Mislabeled samples**: Incorrectly annotated data
can undermine even the most advanced models.
